## üöÄ Welcome to SeleniaProject

Welcome to SeleniaProject, an ambitious, AI-assisted system software project dedicated to building a **complete, comprehensive computing platform entirely from scratch in Rust.**

This project is unique not only in its scope but also in its revolutionary development methodology. As a solo developer, I leverage cutting-edge AI tools to orchestrate the generation, refactoring, and testing of massive codebases, achieving an unprecedented pace of development.

### Our Vision

Our vision is to create a fully integrated, high-performance, and secure computing ecosystem from the ground up, providing unparalleled control and efficiency. SeleniaProject aims to redefine what's possible in system software development.

## üí° What We're Building

SeleniaProject is more than just an operating system; it's a holistic platform including:

* **AetherOS:** A next-generation operating system, designed for performance and security.
* **LumiaDesktop:** A lightweight and intuitive desktop environment.
* **FerroShell:** A powerful and modern shell environment.
* **AeroJS:** A custom-built, high-performance JavaScript engine.
* **Selenet:** Our own web browser, built to integrate seamlessly with the system.
* **AetherNet:** Core networking protocols for reliable and secure communication.
* **Process Manager:** A systemd-compatible process and service manager.

Each component is being meticulously crafted in Rust, ensuring reliability, safety, and speed.

## ü§ñ Our Unique AI-Driven Development Approach

A key differentiator of SeleniaProject is its unique AI-driven development methodology. I work closely with advanced AI tools, such as **Cursor Pro**, which actively assist in:

* **Massive Codebase Generation:** Orchestrating the creation of new functionalities.
* **Complex Refactoring:** Efficiently restructuring and optimizing code.
* **Automated Testing:** Rapidly generating and executing tests to ensure code integrity.

This synergistic approach has enabled an extraordinary development pace, generating **over 6 million lines of agent-assisted code edits in the past 30 days**, contributing to a cumulative total of **nearly 50 million lines to date.** (As evidenced by [link to Cursor's Lines of Agent Edits Graph screenshot/public link if available]).

## üìà Development Progress

While SeleniaProject is still in its foundational development phase, significant progress is being made daily across all core components. The project is currently focused on establishing a robust kernel, essential drivers, and core system utilities, with a strong emphasis on architectural integrity and long-term stability.

## ü§ù Support & Collaboration

SeleniaProject is an ambitious undertaking. We are actively seeking **sponsorships, partnerships, and collaborations** to accelerate development and bring this vision to fruition.

We are particularly interested in support for:

* **High-performance Computing Resources:** Servers and development PCs essential for large-scale compilation, extensive testing, and AI model inference.
* **Advanced Development Tools:** Licenses or access to cutting-edge software development tools and services that enhance productivity and code quality.
